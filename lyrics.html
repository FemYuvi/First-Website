                I lie here paralytic
                Inside this soul
                Screaming for you till
                My throat is numb
                I wanna break out

                I need a way out
                I don't believe that it's gonna be this way
                The worst is
                The waiting
                In this world I'm suffocating

                Feel Your presence
                Filling up my lungs with oxygen
                I take You in
                I've died

                Rebirthing now
                I wanna live forever
                Wanna live for You and me
                (Breathe for the first time now
                I came alive somehow)

                Rebirithing now
                I wanna live my life
                Wanna give You everything
                (Breathe for the first time now
                I came alive somehow)

                Right now
                Right now

                I lie here lifeless
                In this cocoon
                Shedding the skin 'cause
                I'm ready to
                I wanna break out
                I found a way out
                I don't believe that it's gonna be this way
                The worst is
                The waiting
                In this world I'm suffocating

                Feel Your presence
                Filling up my lungs with oxygen
                I take You in
                I've died

                Rebirthing now
                I wanna live forever
                Wanna live for You and me
                (Breathe for the first time now
                I came alive somehow)
                Rebirithing now
                I wanna live my life
                Wanna give You everything
                (Breathe for the first time now
                I came alive somehow)

                Tell me when I'm gonna live again
                Tell me when I'm gonna breathe you in
                Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside
                Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive
                Tell me when I'm gonna live again
                Tell me when this fear will end
                Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside
                Tell me when I'll feel alive

                Rebirthing now
                I wanna live forever
                Wanna live for You and me
                (Breathe for the first time now
                I came alive somehow)
